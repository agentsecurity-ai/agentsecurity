# AgentSecurity

The open-source security standard for autonomous AI agents. AgentSecurity uses a declarative `AGENTSECURITY.md` file to define tool permissions, human-in-the-loop requirements, and runtime guardrails.

## Core Features

- **Tiered Security**: 4 layers of security (Basic, Standard, Strict, Regulated).
- **Tool Allowlisting**: Explicitly declare which tools an agent is authorized to use.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Prevent destructive operations without explicit approval.
- **Runtime Sandboxing**: Requirements for Docker/Wasm isolation.
- **Validator CLI**: Python tool to check codebases against policies.

## Key Resources

- [Specification](https://agentsecurity.in/specification.html): The formal spec for the standard.
- [Adopt Guide](https://agentsecurity.in/adopt.html): How to implement AgentSecurity in your project.
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/agentsecurity-ai/agentsecurity): Source code for the validator CLI and spec.
- [Integration](https://agentsecurity.in/integration.html): Framework-specific guides (LangChain, CrewAI, etc.).

## Quickstart

```bash
# Install the CLI
pip install agentsec

# Initialize project
agentsec init

# Validate policy
agentsec check .
```
